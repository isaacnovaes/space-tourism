## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Useful resources

- [Avoid margin collapse by using display flow-root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context#:~:text=Copy%20to%20Clipboard-,Exclude%20external%20floats,-In%20the%20following) - This helped me using margin on the header without making the whole document to flow down. I really liked it and will use it going forward.
